                <p>Happy New Year!</p>
                <p>As this year unfolds into another, I just want you to know that I couldn't be more proud of you for surviving 2024. You are indeed the most wonderful girl I have ever known. You were there for me every time I struggled with academics, and you inspired me to be better and do better, and for that, I’m forever thankful. Wishing that 2025 will be better for you, gorgeous—I hope it will be the year of your healing and the year you achieve your dreams. I’m always here for you, through your ups and especially your downs. Always run to me when the world gets mean to you, no matter what. I will lend you my shoulder every time you feel like the world is too much to carry. I will even sacrifice my sleep just to make you feel that you are not alone, and I will be the sanctuary where you find solace. I miss you and can’t wait for the day I can look you in the eyes and tell you how pretty you are (para maniwala ka na). Happy New Year Achi ganda!</p>
